## Your First Steps

After installing DAGMod and launching Minecraft, here's how to begin your epic journey:

1.  **Create Your World:** Start a new world or load an existing one. DAGMod features will integrate seamlessly.
2.  **Find the Hall of Champions:** This is your starting hub.
    *   You will receive a **Hall Locator** item in your inventory. Hold it to see the direction to the nearest Hall.
    *   Alternatively, explore naturally! The Hall of Champions is a unique structure that generates in your world.
3.  **Discover Your Heritage (Race Selection):**
    *   Approach the **Race Selection Altar** within the Hall of Champions.
    *   Read the **Race Selection Tome** (you'll receive one upon interacting with the altar) to learn about each of the four races: Human, Dwarf, Elf, and Orc.
    *   Use a **Race Token** (you'll receive one of each upon interacting) at the altar to make your choice.
    *   **Your race choice is permanent, so choose wisely!**
4.  **Choose Your Calling (Class Selection):**
    *   After selecting your race, approach the **Class Selection Altar** (also in the Hall of Champions).
    *   Read the **Class Selection Tome** to study the three classes: Warrior, Mage, and Rogue.
    *   Use a **Class Token** (one of each provided) at the altar to select your class.
    *   **Your class choice can be changed later with Class Reset Potions and Crystals, but your race is permanent.**
5.  **Explore Synergies:**
    *   Your chosen race and class combine to unlock unique **synergy bonuses**. Review these to understand your character's strengths.
6.  **Begin Your Journey:**
    *   Start gaining XP through mining, combat, and exploration.
    *   Progress through 50 levels, earning stat bonuses every 10 levels.
7.  **Begin Questing (Garrick Quests):**
    *   Find **Quest Blocks** within the Hall of Champions or scattered throughout the world.
    *   Interact with a Quest Block to view available quests.
    *   Accept quests appropriate to your current tier and level.
    *   **Initial Quest Example (Novice Tier):** Garrick, the Quest Master, will likely offer you a simple "Gather Wood" or "Kill Zombies" quest to get you started.
    *   Complete quest objectives (gathering items, defeating mobs, exploration).
    *   Return to a Quest Block to claim rewards.
8.  **Progress Through Tiers:**
    *   Complete quests to unlock higher difficulties (Apprentice at Level 5, Expert at Level 15, Master at Level 25).
    *   Embark on your **race-specific epic quest chain** (10 quests per race).
9.  **Explore Dungeons:**
    *   Search for **Bone Dungeons** generating underground for challenging encounters and valuable loot.
10. **Face Bosses:**
