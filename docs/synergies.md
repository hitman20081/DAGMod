# Synergies

When race and class combine, something extraordinary happens. Race-class combinations can unlock unique synergy abilities that go beyond the sum of their parts. These synergies define your character's specialty and playstyle.

**Current Version:** v1.5.4-beta

---

## What Are Synergies?

Synergies are **special passive bonuses** that activate when you combine a specific race with a specific class. They stack with your base race and class bonuses, creating powerful specialized builds.

**Important:** Synergies are **passive abilities** that activate automatically. This is different from **class abilities** (like Rage, Arcane Barrier, Assassinate), which are active abilities you manually use.

**All synergies in DAGMod are passive** and activate based on conditions like location, health level, or combat state.

## Confirmed Synergies (9 Total)

Based on the mod's code, **9 race-class combinations have unique synergy abilities**. The remaining 3 combinations don't have special synergies beyond their combined base bonuses.

## 👤 Human Synergies

### Human Warrior - The Adaptable Guardian ✅
**Theme:** Defensive adaptability through temporary protection

**Synergy Ability: "Absorption Shield"**
- When taking damage, gain Absorption I for 10 seconds (200 ticks).
- This provides a temporary extra health buffer that absorbs damage.
- The effect is not re-applied if it is already active.

**Why It Works:**
Humans lack specialized racial bonuses, so their synergy focuses on reactive defense. The Absorption hearts give Warriors extra survivability that adapts to combat situations, letting them tank damage bursts effectively.

**Best For:** Players who want a reliable, forgiving tank build

**Strategy:** Engage aggressively knowing you'll gain extra protection when hit. The absorption buffer lets you take risks other tanks can't. Combined with Warrior's 6 abilities (including Battle Shout healing and Iron Skin damage reduction), you're incredibly durable.

---

### Human Mage - The Versatile Spellcaster ✅
**Theme:** Unpredictable magical surges reflecting human adaptability

**Synergy Ability: "Arcane Surge"**
- 1% chance per tick to gain Regeneration I for 5 seconds (100 ticks).
- Unpredictable but powerful healing.
- Reflects human adaptability and versatility.
- Can trigger at critical moments.
- Helps offset Mage's fragility.

**Why It Works:**
Human Mages exemplify versatility. The random regeneration makes them surprisingly resilient despite their fragile nature, and the unpredictability keeps gameplay interesting.

**Best For:** Players who enjoy adaptable, unpredictable playstyles

**Strategy:** The random healing can save your life when it matters. Play aggressively for a Mage, knowing you have backup healing potential. Combined with Arcane Barrier (10 absorption hearts), you're more durable than expected.

---

### Human Rogue - The Mobile Scout ✅
**Theme:** Enhanced mobility through unpredictable movement boosts

**Synergy Ability: "Parkour Master"**
- 0.5% chance per tick to gain Jump Boost I for 10 seconds (200 ticks).
- Enhanced vertical mobility.
- Unpredictable but useful for escape and exploration.
- Stacks with Rogue's +30% speed bonus.
- Great for building and traversal.

**Why It Works:**
Human Rogues gain even more mobility, making them exceptional scouts and explorers. The random jump boosts create dynamic movement opportunities.

**Best For:** Players who love exploration and creative movement

**Strategy:** Use the random jump boosts to access unexpected locations, escape danger, and outmaneuver enemies in three dimensions. Combined with Rogue's 7 abilities (including Blink Strike teleport and Vanish invisibility), you're incredibly mobile.

---

## ⛏️ Dwarf Synergies

### Dwarf Warrior - The Mountain's Shield ✅
**Theme:** Unstoppable underground tank

**Synergy Ability: "Stone's Endurance"**
- **Resistance effect when underground** (below Y=50)
- Significantly reduced damage taken in caves
- Stacks with Dwarf's +1 heart and Warrior's 6 abilities
- Makes you nearly unkillable in mining/caving
- Permanent effect while underground
- Checked periodically (every ~1 second)

**Why It Works:**
Dwarves are born underground, and Dwarf Warriors become absolute walls when below ground. Combined with high HP, mining bonuses, and Warrior abilities (Iron Skin, Battle Shout), this is the ultimate cave exploration build.

**Best For:** Players who spend most time mining, caving, and underground

**Strategy:** Dive deep without fear. You're the toughest thing underground. Perfect for cave exploration, ore gathering, and underground base building. Use Iron Skin underground for absolutely absurd damage reduction (Resistance II + synergy Resistance).

---

### Dwarf Mage - The Forge Master ✅
**Theme:** Mountain-born spellcaster with forge heritage

**Synergy Ability: "Forge-Born"**
- **Permanent Fire Resistance**
- Never take fire or lava damage
- Reflects Dwarf forge heritage
- Explore the Nether safely
- Mine near lava without risk

**Why It Works:**
Dwarves work in forges and deep mines where lava flows. This synergy makes Dwarf Mages the safest Nether explorers and lets them work near lava without the usual Mage fragility being a problem.

**Best For:** Nether exploration, lava-side building, fire-based challenges

**Strategy:** Explore lava lakes and Nether fortresses without fear. Build bases near lava for aesthetics without risk. Excellent for blaze farming and Nether resources. Combined with Mage's 4 abilities (Arcane Barrier, Time Warp), you can safely explore dangerous areas.

---

### Dwarf Rogue - The Cave Explorer ❌
**Theme:** Natural combination of mining expertise and agility

**Combined Bonuses:**
- Dwarf: +2 HP, +20% mining speed, ore bonuses
- Rogue: +4 HP, +30% movement speed, 7 abilities, reduced fall damage

**Why It Works:**
Fast, efficient underground exploration. You move quickly through caves (Rogue speed) while gathering resources efficiently (Dwarf mining). The 7 Rogue abilities provide excellent tools for cave survival.

**Best For:** Efficient resource gathering with high mobility

**Strategy:** Speed-mine through caves using mobility and Rogue abilities to avoid unnecessary fights. Use Vanish to escape danger, Blink Strike to reposition, and Assassinate for burst damage when needed.

---

## 🌲 Elf Synergies

### Elf Warrior - The Forest Fighter ❌
**Theme:** Natural combination of speed and strength

**Combined Bonuses:**
- Elf: +15% movement speed, +0.5 reach, Hero of the Village, wood/leaf bonuses
- Warrior: 6 abilities, high survivability, melee damage

**Why It Works:**
Fast, mobile Warrior with extended reach. The movement speed makes you highly mobile for a tank. The 6 Warrior abilities (Whirlwind, Battle Shout, Iron Skin, etc.) combined with Elf agility creates a hit-and-run tank playstyle.

**Best For:** Mobile tank builds, forest dwellers

**Strategy:** Use speed to position optimally, extended reach to hit from safer distance. Build bases in forests for wood/leaf gathering bonuses. The Guardian of the Wilds quest chain rewards Elytra for ultimate mobility.

---

### Elf Mage - The Nature Channeler ✅
**Theme:** Magic amplified by natural energy

**Synergy Ability: "Forest Attunement"**
- **Haste effect in forest biomes**
- Faster spell casting and movement in forests
- Natural magical amplification
- Stacks with Elf's existing +15% speed
- Incredibly fast in natural environments
- Checks biome type periodically

**Why It Works:**
Elf Mages channel natural magic. In forests, their connection to nature accelerates everything they do, making them the fastest casters in the game when fighting on home ground.

**Best For:** Forest-dwelling spellcasters who want maximum speed

**Strategy:** Build your base in a forest. You'll cast faster, move faster, and gather crops faster. Combined with Mage's 4 abilities (Arcane Missiles, Time Warp, Mana Burst, Arcane Barrier), you have incredible versatility and speed. Ultimate support character in wooded terrain.

---

### Elf Rogue - The Shadow Leaf ✅
**Theme:** Perfect stealth predator in natural environments

**Synergy Ability: "Forest Phantom"**
- **Becomes invisible in forests when sneaking**
- Perfect camouflage in wooded areas
- Ultimate ambush predator
- Combines with Rogue's 7 abilities
- Nearly undetectable in natural habitat
- Checks: Must be sneaking + in forest biome

**Why It Works:**
This is one of the most powerful synergies for stealth gameplay. Elf Rogues in forests are virtually impossible to detect, making them perfect assassins and scouts.

**Best For:** Stealth gameplay, ambushes, PvP in forested areas

**Strategy:** Use forests as your hunting ground. Become completely invisible while sneaking, set up ambushes, and strike before enemies know you're there. Combined with Blink Strike (teleport), Vanish (invisibility anywhere), and Assassinate (backstab), you're the ultimate assassin. Exceptional for PvP if enabled.

---

## 💪 Orc Synergies

### Orc Warrior - The Berserker ✅
**Theme:** Unstoppable rage when cornered

**Synergy Ability: "Berserker Rage"**
- **Activates when below 30% health**
- Gains Strength AND Speed effects
- Becomes more dangerous when wounded
- Turn near-death into advantage
- Risk/reward gameplay
- Continuously monitored during combat

**Why It Works:**
Orcs fight hardest when cornered. This synergy rewards aggressive play and makes Orc Warriors extremely dangerous even when low on health. The lower your HP, the more deadly you become.

**Best For:** Aggressive players who like high-risk combat

**Strategy:** Don't run when low on health - FIGHT. Your berserker rage makes you faster and stronger. Push through difficult fights knowing you get stronger as you take damage. Combined with Warrior's Battle Shout (healing) and Iron Skin (damage reduction), you can intentionally trigger berserker rage then heal back up for devastating damage phases.

---

### Orc Mage - The Resilient Caster ❌
**Theme:** Natural combination of magical power and physical resilience

**Combined Bonuses:**
- Orc: +6 HP, +15% melee damage
- Mage: 4 abilities + wands + scrolls, enchanting/brewing bonuses

**Why It Works:**
Orc Mages are battle mages who can take hits while casting. Their extra health from Orc heritage offsets Mage's fragility, creating a unique aggressive caster playstyle.

**Best For:** Players who want to play Mage aggressively

**Strategy:** Fight at closer ranges than other Mages. Use your extra health to your advantage. Combined with Arcane Barrier (10 absorption hearts), you have significant durability for a caster. You're a battle mage, not a glass cannon - get in the thick of combat.

---

### Orc Rogue - The Savage Hunter ✅
**Theme:** Brutal precision strikes and enhanced hunting

**Synergy Ability: "Predator's Strike"**
- **+20% extra backstab damage** (stacks with base Rogue +50% backstab)
- Massive burst damage from behind
- Already high Orc melee damage (+15%) gets amplified further
- Most devastating single-target damage in game
- Perfect hunter and assassin
- Applies to all backstab attacks

**Why It Works:**
Combines Orc's raw power with Rogue's precision. The stacking backstab damage makes Orc Rogues the highest burst damage build in the game when attacking from behind.

**Math:** Base damage × Rogue backstab (1.5×) × Orc bonus (1.2×) × Assassinate (20 damage) = INSANE DAMAGE

**Best For:** Maximum damage output, hunting, assassination gameplay

**Strategy:** Always position for backstabs. Your damage from behind is unmatched. Combined with Assassinate ability (20 damage backstab) and Blink Strike (teleport behind enemies), you can delete targets instantly. Perfect for hunting animals efficiently and devastating sneak attacks in combat.
