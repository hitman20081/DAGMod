## Quest Tier System (4 Tiers)

### Tier Progression

You must progress through tiers in order, unlocking each new tier as you level up:

**Novice (Level 1)** → **Apprentice (Level 5)** → **Expert (Level 15)** → **Master (Level 25)**

Each tier has its own set of quests with increasing difficulty and rewards. You cannot accept higher-tier quests until you've reached the required level.

### Quest Tier Requirements

| Tier | Level Required | XP Reward per Quest | Difficulty |
|------|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| Novice | Level 1 | 200 XP | Tutorial/Beginner |
| Apprentice | Level 5 | 500 XP | Easy |
| Expert | Level 15 | 1500 XP | Hard |
| Master | Level 25 | 2500 XP | Very Hard |

**Note:** These are standard quest rewards. Race-specific quest chain rewards match these values for their respective tiers.

### Level Gating

Quests are **level-gated** to ensure proper progression:
- **Novice quests:** Available at level 1 (start of game)
- **Apprentice quests:** Unlock at level 5
- **Expert quests:** Unlock at level 15
- **Master quests:** Unlock at level 25

If you try to accept a quest above your level, you'll receive a clear message indicating the level requirement.
