### Rogue DUAL Ability System

Rogues are unique - they have **TWO separate ability systems** that work together:

#### SYSTEM 1: Energy-Based Abilities (Rogue Ability Tome)

**Requires:** Rogue Ability Tome
**How It Works:**
- Uses energy resource (not cooldowns)
- Visual HUD shows current energy
- Energy regenerates over time
- Cycle between 3 abilities

**Energy-Based Abilities (3):**

**1. Smoke Bomb**
**Energy Cost:** 40

#### SYSTEM 2: Cooldown-Based Abilities (Individual Items)
