## ✨ Core Features

*   **🎭 Choose Your Path**: Combine one of **4 distinct races** (Human, Dwarf, Elf, Orc) with one of **3 powerful classes** (Warrior, Mage, Rogue). Unlock one of 9 unique **synergies** based on your choice, granting special passive abilities.

*   **📈 Level Up & Grow Stronger**: Progress from level 1 to 50 with a classic XP system. Gain experience from combat, mining, quests, and more to earn stat points, unlock new quest tiers, and become a legend.

*   **📜 Embark on Epic Quests**: Discover over **64 quests** through a multi-layered system. Start with a tutorial from **Innkeeper Garrick** in a village tavern, then accept story quests from **Quest Blocks** and quick jobs from **Job Boards**.

*   **⚔️ Master Unique Abilities**: Unleash devastating power with over **15 unique class abilities**. Whether you're a Warrior spinning through hordes of enemies, a Mage warping time, or a Rogue teleporting behind foes, combat is dynamic and engaging.

*   **🏰 Explore a Living World**: The world is alive with new structures. Discover procedurally generated **Bone Dungeons** deep underground, face the formidable **Skeleton King** and his minions, and find shelter in new **Village Inns, Taverns, and Shops**.

## 🚀 Getting Started
